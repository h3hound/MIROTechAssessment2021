Problem Definition: Write a program in the language of your choice to extract the skill sets and corresponding jobs with that skill set in listed 

The skill set you are looking for is “engineering and technology”

Then list all the jobs that have this skill in the job requirement

Output: A link to your github repo and how you solved it. This is going to be similar to some of the work you will be doing in this role. You will be looking at existing HR systems providers, what APIs they have available and how we extract that data and push that data somewhere else. Also think about error handling.

Bonus: Create an array of all the jobs with the skill and push the payload to a requestbin (http://requestbin.net/) as if you are pushing the data into another system. Take a screenshot of the bin and submit with your git. The reason for this is the requestbin link expires after a certain time has elapsed. Please also submit the link to the requestbin
